      <description>My Experience Taking the AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals Exam One of my former colleagues mentioned that he had just earned his Azure Fundamentals certification as it was required by his employer. He described it as a simple and easy exam to pass, and he suggested I do the same. Considering I was planning to get into &amp;quot;the cloud&amp;quot; for some time, I saw this as the perfect opportunity. After procrastinating for months, I finally decided to take advantage of my CBT Nuggets subscription, kindly provided by my employer, and watched the 9-hour video series covering the exam.</description>

      <description>Add a Syslog Server to all your Meraki MX devices using ANSIBLE. List all the MERAKI devices on your organization. (Or the ones you want to affect with this playbook)
One easy way to do that is to use POSTMAN. We can take advantage of the MERAKI collection available. For this case we will use the List the Netowrks in an Organitation API call
GET {{baseUrl}}/organizations/:organizationId/networks This API call will return the list of all networks (in our cas all of them are MX devices).</description>
