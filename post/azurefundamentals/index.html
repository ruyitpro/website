<p>One of my former colleagues mentioned that he had just earned his Azure
Fundamentals certification as it was required by his employer. He
described it as a simple and easy exam to pass, and he suggested I do
the same. Considering I was planning to get into &quot;the cloud&quot; for some
time, I saw this as the perfect opportunity. After procrastinating for
months, I finally decided to take advantage of my CBT Nuggets
subscription, kindly provided by my employer, and watched the 9-hour
video series covering the exam.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="../images/CBT.PNG" alt="a"  />
</p>
<p>During my day, I managed to find 30 to 40 minutes to watch the videos at
2x speed and take notes since most of the concepts were familiar to me.
For some topics, I had to watch the videos twice to ensure I fully
understood them, especially those explaining how Azure is structured and
where to find what you need. It took me 6 days to complete this.</p>
<p>After completing the CBT Nuggets series, I moved on to
(<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nED0_vMEniWBQjSoxTsBYS3"> John Savill's
Technical Training YouTube playlist </a>).
However, when I reached 40% progress on this playlist, I realized that
it was mostly repeating what I had already learned from the CBT Nuggets
course. So, I decided to go for it and booked my test just two days
later.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="../images/John.PNG" alt="a"  />
</p>
<p>The day before my test, I took four practice tests on the Microsoft
official site
(<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/certifications/exams/az-900/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&amp;assessmentId=23"> Practice Test </a>).
I scored between 85 and 98 on these practice tests, which boosted my
confidence.</p>
<p>This was my first certification using OnVUE, the at-home option from
PEARSON VUE. The process was straightforward after watching a couple of
YouTube videos and following all the tips, such as keeping my room as

wasn't entirely sure how to answer. Nevertheless, it was a quick win
